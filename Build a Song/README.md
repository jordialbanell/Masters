The code necessary for this level is broken down into several different components.

The player is controlled using PlayerMovement.cs along with MouseLook.cs

Each audio component has its own code; Piano.cs, Drums.cs, Guitar.cs, Vocals.cs

For the submition button, there are two files, BuildASongButt.cs and KeySubmit.cs

The timer.cs file is linked to the PlayerMovement, allowing there to be a timer on all rooms
